The discourse between **Shri Krishna** and **Arjun** took place just before the onset of war , a great fratricidal conflict between hundred son of **Dhritrashtra** and on the opposing side their cousin the **Pandav** for the son of **Pandu**.

Dhritrashtra and Pandu were born in Guru dynasty descending from **King Bharat** from whom the **Mahabharat** derives its name dhritrashtra was born blind so The throne was passed down to his younger brother Pandu.

After the death of Pandu at an early age is 5 childrens **Yudhisthira , Bheem, Arjun , Nakul and Sahdev** came under the care of dhritrashtra who in effect became King for a time being. Thus the son of Pandu and dhritrashtra grew of the in the same royal household both were trained in military arts by expert **Dronacharya** and counseled by the revered grandfather of the clan **Bhishma Pitamah**. 

The son of dhritrashtra **Duryodhan** hated and envied the Pandav and Dhritrashtra wanted his own son not those of Pandu to inherit The Kingdom.

Thus , Duryodhan plotted to killed young sons of Pandu and it was only by the careful protection of their uncle **Vidur** and their cousin lord Krishna that the Pandav escape The many attempts against their life.

Lord Krishna was the Supreme god head himself who was playing a role of a prince in a contemporary dynasty . In this role he was also the nephew of Pandu's wife **Kunti** the mother of Pandav so both as a relative and as the eternal upholder of religion Krishna favoured the righteous son of Pandu and protected them.

However Duryodhan challenged Pandavas to gambling match . In the course of the earth faithful tournament Duryodhan and his brother took possession of **Draupadi**, the chaste and devoted wife of the Pandav and insultingly tried to strip her naked before the entire assembly of Prince and Kings . Krishna's devine intervention shaved her , but the gambling which was rigged , cheated the Pandavas of their Kingdom and forced them into 13 year of exile.

After returning from exile the Pandavas rightfully requested their kingdom from Duryodhan who refused to yield it. Duty bound as Princes to serve in public administration the five Pandavas reduce their request to Mere 5 village but Duryodhan arrogantly replied that he wouldn't spare them enough land into which to drive a pin.

Throughout all this the Pandavas had been consistently tolerant and forbearing. But now war seemed inevitable.

Nonetheless , as the prince of the world divided some sided with the son of dhritrashtra , other with the Pandavas , Krishna himself took the role of Messenger for the son of Pandu and went to the court of Dhritrashtra rashtra to plead for peace . When his pleas were refused war was now certain.

The Pandavas, men of the highest moral stature, recognized Krsna to be the **Supreme Personality of Godhead**, whereas the impious sons of Dhṛtarăştra did not. Yet Krsna offered to enter the war according to the desire of the antagonists. As God, He would not personally fight; but whoever so desired might avail himself of Krsna's army-and the other side could have **Kṛṣṇa** Himself, as an advisor and helper. Duryodhana, the political genius, snatched at Krsna's armed forces, while the Pandavas were equally eager to have Kṛṣṇa Himself.

In this way, Kṛṣṇa became the **charioteer of Arjuna**, taking it upon Himself to drive the fabled bowman's chariot. This brings us to the point at which **Bhagavad-gītā** begins, with the two armies arrayed, ready for combat, and DhṛtarThe discourse between **Shri Krishna** and **Arjun** took place just before the onset of war , a great fratricidal conflict between hundred son of **Dhritrashtra** and on the opposing side their cousin the **Pandav** for the son of **Pandu**.
